                area has not burned. For this reason, we consider the area of these polygons as "impacted", not burned.

                It is very important to note that the data in this project may not be perfectly accurate for various reasons. While the data is the best available, we had to remove insiginficant fires and simplify polygon vertices for storage reasons. The 2020 data has
                not been finalized because the season is still active, and for historical data, the accuracy of mapping generally has increased over time thanks to satellites and modern GPS. This is not to say this is not good data or the trends shown
                here are invalid - there is no doubt that wildfires are increasing in size. Instead, we hope this visualization intrigues the viewer to do their own fact finding and explore this increasingly important phenomena.
