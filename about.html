                enriched with data from the <a href="https://gacc.nifc.gov/sacc/predictive/intelligence/NationalLargeIncidentYTDReport.pdf">National Large Incident Report</a>. 
                These data are preliminary until the data is reviewed by scientists in early 2021.

                California Fire History (data retrieved Nov 21, 2020)

            <li>
                Wildfire Perimeters - <a href="https://frap.fire.ca.gov/frap-projects/fire-perimeters/">Cal Fire</a>. These data have been reviewed and published, 
                but the data are for the outer perimeters of the fire; in some cases, the entire polygon area has not burned. For this reason,
                we consider the area of these polygons as "impacted", not burned.

                California Counties - <a href="https://gis.data.ca.gov/datasets/CALFIRE-Forestry::california-county-boundaries">State of California</a>. The area of 
                each county was calculated with ArcGIS Pro, as were the total area impacted for the two climate periods using the above CA wildfire perimeter data.

                It is very important to note that the data in this project may not be perfectly accurate for various reasons. 
                While the data is the best available, we had to remove insiginficant fires and simplify polygon vertices for 
                storage reasons. The 2020 data has not been finalized because the season is still active, and for historical data,
                the accuracy of mapping generally has increased over time thanks to satellites and modern GPS.
                This is not to say this is not good data or the trends shown here are invalid - there is no doubt 
                that wildfires are increasing in size. Instead, we hope this visualization intrigues the viewer to 
                do their own fact finding and explore this increasingly important phenomena.
