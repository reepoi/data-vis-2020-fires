# Visualization Features
2020 US Wildfire Visualization
- Point data and bars are encoded by a black to red color scale according to the data in the filter.
- In the map view, point data is removed and polygon data added after zooming past 50 km in extent.
- Selections are synced between the points, polygons, and bars.
- When selected, the map automatically pans and zooms to the polygon extent of the fire.
- The data in the views of the bar chart and map can be updated, and the data can futher be filtered.
- An information icon can be clicked to walk the user through the visualization.
- In the map view, the home button can be clicked to reset the extent.

California Wildfire History
- The top 20 CA wildfires are displayed in a bubble chart, encoded by year (color/position) and acres burned (size).
- The map and donut chart are coordinated to show the number of acres burned by county, based on the user's selection.

National Wildfire History
- The scatterplot includes a best fit line. Each dataset can be clicked to highlight the selection.
